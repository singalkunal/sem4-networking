(a) Write a program to create one child process of a parent process by making use of fork. Print the process id and parentâ€™s process id of each of the parent and child process using getpid, getppid system calls. Sleep the child process for random period (0 to 5 seconds) using sleep and rand functions. Force the parent process to wait till the child process exits. Child process exits with some status passing to parent process using exit system call. Receive the exit status of the child process in the parent process.<br/><br/>
(b) Get exposure of ps, kill Linux commands. Send SIGKILL signal using kill command to any running process.<br/><br/>
(c) Write signal handler function to handle Ctrl-c (SIGINT). Send SIGINT signal from a parent process to its child process. Also, verify the functionality by sending the SIGINT signal from command prompt to the child process from the keyboard.
